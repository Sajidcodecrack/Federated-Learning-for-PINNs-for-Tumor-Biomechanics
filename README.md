**Federated Physics-Informed Learning with Agent-Based Orchestration**

>  **Research-Only Project**  
> This repository implements a machine learning research framework.  
> It is **not intended for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, or medical decision-making**.

##  Overview

This project presents a **privacy-preserving, physics-guided machine learning framework** for neuro-oncological biomechanics analysis using medical imaging data.

The framework integrates:
- **Federated Learning (FL)** for collaborative model training without sharing raw medical data
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to enforce biomechanical consistency
- **Agent-Based Orchestration** to coordinate training, validation, aggregation, and explanation

The system is designed **strictly for academic research and decision-support experimentation**.

---

##  Motivation

Current AI-based brain tumor analysis systems face several limitations:
- Centralized data collection raises **privacy and regulatory concerns**
- Purely data-driven models lack **physical interpretability**
- Smaller institutions struggle with **limited labeled datasets**
- Biomechanical effects (e.g., tissue deformation) are often ignored

This project addresses these challenges by combining **federated learning**, **physics-based constraints**, and **modular orchestration**.

##  Data Description

### 1. Medical Imaging
- Brain MRI images
- Public, anonymized datasets only
- Tumor classes:
  - Glioma
  - Meningioma
  - Pituitary Tumor
  - No Tumor

### 2. Structured Metadata (CSV)
Used to condition biomechanical behavior:
- Patient age (simulated or extracted)
- Tumor type
- Tumor size
- Slice index
- Scanner or site-level metadata (if available)

---

##  Methodology

### 🔹 Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
- Models tumor-induced tissue deformation
- Embeds governing physical laws (e.g., linear elasticity)
- Ensures biomechanically meaningful outputs

### 🔹 Federated Learning
- Each site trains a **local PINN**
- Only model parameters are shared
- Central aggregation preserves privacy

### 🔹 Agent-Based Orchestration
The pipeline is organized into modular agents:

| Agent | Role |
|------|------|
| Training Agent | Local PINN training |
| Physics Validation Agent | Physical consistency checking |
| Federation Agent | Physics-aware model aggregation |
| Security Agent (Optional) | Anomaly detection |
| Explanation Agent (Optional) | Human-readable summaries |

- Corresponding metadata (CSV)

---

##  Outputs

For each input sample, the system produces:
